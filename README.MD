## FAQs:

- Why did you name it **Py**CMD? 
>  ¯\\_\(ツ\)\_\/¯, but I think it's an **ok** name. Also `Py` represents the Python language in which PYCMD was written. Not the best name, but i'm bad at keeping names. 

- Why should I use PyCMD?
> PyCMD saves you a lot of time, you can use it to manage your projects if they are messy or if you want to make a lot of changes in short time. Not only that but also it will help you to make your projects more readable and maintainable.

- What are the Pros and Cons of PyCMD?

> | Pros | Cons |
> | ---- | ---- |
> | Easy to use | Might be an overkill |
> | Saves Time | Only compaitable with Windows currently |
> | Generates Boiler Plate | |
> | Easy to install/uninstall | |
> | Manages GIT | |
> | Light (Doesn't take too much space) |


- Does PyCMD collect any user data?
> No, PyCMD doesn't collect any user data. It stores the configuration in your local storage in the file `json/config.json`.
